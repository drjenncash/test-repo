    "This Jupyter Notebook provides an introduction to how notebooks work. It demonstrates how to execute code and markdown text cells, how to import Python packages and learn about their modules, and provides links to further documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook also demonstrates the basic functionality of the Rubin Science Platform (RSP) installed at the Interim Data Facility (IDF; the Google Cloud), such as how to use the TAP service to query and retrieve catalog data; matplotlib to plot catalog data; the LSST Butler package to query and retrieve image data; and the LSST afwDisplay package to display images.\n",

    "This Notebook uses the Data Preview 0.2 (DP0.2) data set. This data set uses a subset of the DESC's Data Challenge 2 (DC2) simulated images, which have been *reprocessed* by Rubin Observatory using Version 23 of the LSST Science Pipelines. More information about the simulated data can be found in the <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..253...31L/abstract\">DESC's DC2 paper</a> and in the <a href=\"https://dp0-2.lsst.io\">DP0.2 data release documentation</a>."
